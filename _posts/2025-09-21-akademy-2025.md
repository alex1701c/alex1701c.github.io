Like every year, one of the highlights is Akademy! This time we were in Berlin, making it quite easy to get there from Hamburg:)
The weather was surprisingly nice, especially when heading out in the evening to try lots of different restaurants.
And of course - since being in Berlin - you gotta try a local DÃ¶ner there :D.

One talk I was particularly surprised about was Saturday's keynote "Open by Design: How Governments Can Lead the Shift to Digital Sovereignty" by Alexander Rosenthal.
Besides the information about OpenSource-Software being used on different levels of federal/state/local, the aspects of OpenData.
This made me realize that software is not the only thing one should focus on being open.  
Also, the huge amount of memes in the slides made the talk super refreshing and a nice start into Akademy!

Nate's talk "Minding the Big Picture: Opportunity From Chaos" also fit this topic. OpenSource can provide a stable foundation
and reduced dependence on individual companies.

My main development focus and also the most frequent topic of the blog is the Clazy project. Akademy is a good occasion to tell other people about it.
So I took the occasion and held a fast-track talk about Clazy to tell how awesome and useful it is.  
It was also quite good to get people talking about it and share their ideas/problems.

I also did a decent amount of coding on Clazy. This included a request from aacid about Clazy not working properly with a Qt variant
that is build into a specific namespace. This was quite the rabbithole, but I managed to get the passing tests from 50% to 90%.
The last few edgecases are not as relevant if most of Clazy works properly.
For the use-arrow-operator-instead-of-data a false-positive is fixed where the check complains if you do a `.data()` call and then cast the pointer.
This is in most cases needed, if not, clang-tidy should warn about unneeded casts.  
Finally, fixits for detaching-temporary and detaching-member are more reliable when multiple calls are chained.

The biggest surprise though came at the Akademy awards. I am very honored to have received one, this left me quite speechless.

_Me finally catching some words after getting the Award <3_

This also means I am responsible for choosing the person for next year's award. So you better get busy doing cool stuff ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘€.

Finally, I want to thank everyone who helped organize Akademy and made it as awesome as it was!
