üéâ **New Clazy Release: Stability Boost & New Checks!**

We‚Äôre excited to roll out a new Clazy release packed with bug fixes, a new check, and improvements to existing checks.
This release included 34 commits from 5 contributors.

## üîç New Features & Improvements

- **New Check: `readlock-detaching`**  
  Detects unsafe and likely unwanted detachment of member-containers while holding a read lock.
  For example, when calling `.first()` on the mutable member instead of `.constFirst()`

- **Expanded Support for Detaching Checks**  
  Additional methods now covered when checking for detaching temporary or member lists/maps.
  This includes reverse iterators on many Qt containers and `keyValueBegin`/`keyValueEnd` on QMap.
  All those methods have `const` counterparts that allow you to avoid detaching.

- **Internal Changes**
  With this release, Clang 19 or later is a required dependency. All older versions needed compatibility logic
  and were not thouroughly tested on CI. In case you are on an older Version of a Debian based distro, consider
  using https://apt.llvm.org/ and compile Clazy from source ;)
