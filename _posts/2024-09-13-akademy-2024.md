### Akademy 2024 in W√ºrzburg - it was a blast

My second Akademy and has ended just yesterday. It was an amazing and productive time again!
Apart from familiar faces I know from last year's Akademy or the Plasma sprint last year in Augsburg, I met plenty of new faces.
Some of which I of course had contact in KDE before, but only in the digital world.

One of the best parts was again the day trip with the KDE Community. While it was a bit rainy, we for sure made the best of it and saw the beautiful city of "Rothenburg ob der Tauber". The view from the town hall tower was very beautiful:

The talks were also quite interesting and highlighted how many facades the KDE Community has. Apart from the lightning talks being great again, the "QML in Qt6" talk was quite valuable, because I did not manage to follow up closely on the latest improvements.  
The talks and BOFs related to the KDE goals were also quite beneficial in getting a good impression in what direction we want to go.

Since we had so many interesting talks, it was not possible to join all of them. What I will follow up on later are the talks "Pythonizing Qt" and "C++, Rust and Qt: Easier than you think".

Albert Astals Cid and I gave a lightning talk together about JSON linting (my part) and QML linting (his part). We were only able to touch the surface in the given time, but had some productive discussions and follow-up questions afterward. I will create a post about the JSON validation/JSON schema topic in the future, since I am still working on some aspects of this.

It has been great again to also do some hacking together and discuss ideas in-person. I will miss being able to say "Let's discuss this at Akademy?" on merge requests ;).  
I did quite a bit of hacking on KRunner, linting/formatting related tooling and also [Clazy](https://invent.kde.org/sdk/clazy/).  
This can also be seen on my GitLab history that has turned a bit more blue and thus active:

What was a great improvement over the last Akademy were the chicken noises to make sure people stay within the time of their talk!
To better improve on that, we should maybe get some real chicken next year ü•öüê£üêî. The talks on how to apply for funding in KDE might contain useful info when working towards this ;)
PS: My life-long profile picture on GitHub/GitLab is of the super cute chicken I had ü•∞.
