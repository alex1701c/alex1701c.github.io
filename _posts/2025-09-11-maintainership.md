### Becoming the official Maintainer of Clazy

During this year's Akademy in Berlin, I gave a talk about the awesome features & usecases of Clazy.
Afterwards, I also talked with Ivan Čukić and the topic of maintainership. Sérgio Martins was the original author and long
time maintainer. Ivan has taken this responsibility internally in KDAB, but was not able to find enough time for the project.

I am very honored that he transferred maintainership of Clazy to me. I'll do my best to continue pushing the project forward.
Also thanks to Sérgio and Ivan for their previous work and KDAB for supporting it.

In case you want to get started in Clazy development, your contributions are welcome! Feel free to reach out to me if you have issues with getting started :)
